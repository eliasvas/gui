### _simple GUI library in C99_

This is an experiment on a hybrid UI system.
Major goals are portability, maintainability and expresiveness.
Main inspiration are Ryan's [blog posts](https://www.rfleury.com/p/ui-series-table-of-contents) on Immediate-Mode GUI design.
An interactive demo can be viewed [here](https://pages.github.com/).
### Features
- Zero dependencies C99 codebase
- Loads of layouting options (thanks to Retained state)
